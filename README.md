### The Game Previously Known as ProgressiveBR

### How to play (LAN):

Either download project from here, or download the build from https://github.com/jvanvurenj/brgamebuild

If you cloned this repo, open it in Unity and build the game for your system.

Navigate to the build, whether you built it or downloaded the build and open the game.

You will need one player to be the Host. 

The Host selects the Host Game option, and a lobby will open.

All other players will need the Host's IP address, put it in the box next to "Join Game" and then Join the game.

Once 2 or more players have joined and everyone in the lobby has Ready'd Up, the game will begin.

Instruction on how to play are in the lobby screen.

Alternatively, if you want to test the game, you can run multiple instances. Have on client be the Host, then have all other clients connect to "localhost"
